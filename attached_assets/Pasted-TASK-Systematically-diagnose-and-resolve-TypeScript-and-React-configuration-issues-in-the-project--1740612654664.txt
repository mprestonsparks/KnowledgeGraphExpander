TASK: Systematically diagnose and resolve TypeScript and React configuration issues in the project, specifically addressing the following problems:

1. **JSX Component Issue with Loader2:**
   - Verify that the package "lucide-react" is installed and up to date.
   - Check that the project uses a compatible version of React and TypeScript.
   - Ensure the tsconfig.json file is configured with the proper "jsx" setting (e.g., "react-jsx" for React 17+/18) and consider enabling "skipLibCheck": true to bypass library type conflicts.
   - Confirm that there are no conflicting versions of @types/react installed.

2. **Implicit 'any' Type in Event Handlers:**
   - Scan the code for event handler functions that lack explicit type annotations.
   - Update each handler by specifying the correct event type, e.g., change:
     ```tsx
     onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
     ```
     to:
     ```tsx
     onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => setInput(e.target.value)}
     ```
   - Similarly, update other handlers (like onChange for <Input>) with the appropriate types such as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>.

3. **Path Alias Configuration Issues:**
   - Inspect the tsconfig.json to ensure that "baseUrl" is set (e.g., ".") and that "paths" is configured to map "@" to the correct source directory:
     ```json
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         "baseUrl": ".",
         "paths": {
           "@/*": ["src/*"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Verify that all import statements using "@/..." correspond to actual file paths in the project directory.

4. **General Project Clean-Up:**
   - Remove any unused imports (for instance, unused testing utilities like "screen").
   - Rebuild the project and run tests to confirm that all issues are resolved.
   - Document any changes made for future reference.

WORKFLOW EXECUTION:
- **Step 1:** Run a dependency audit to confirm that packages (lucide-react, react, react-dom, TypeScript) are the latest versions.
- **Step 2:** Open and validate the tsconfig.json file for the required compiler options and path aliases.
- **Step 3:** Search through the codebase for event handlers that are missing type annotations and update them accordingly.
- **Step 4:** Verify that all path alias imports are correctly mapped to existing files.
- **Step 5:** Remove or refactor unused imports.
- **Step 6:** Rebuild the project and run the test suite to ensure that all errors are resolved.

Please execute the above steps systematically, logging any changes and verifying that the resolution addresses the errors in question.
