1. Identify the Correct Server for /graph
	•	Check your code to see which framework (FastAPI or Express) should handle /graph.
	•	Ensure only one server is bound to Replit’s main port (usually 3000). If both are needed, run them on separate ports or set up a proxy.

2. Verify Port Assignments
	•	Replit typically exposes port 3000.
	•	FastAPI: If you see Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:3000, it’s using port 3000.
	•	Express: If also listening on 3000, it creates conflicts.
	•	Solution:
	•	Let FastAPI have port 3000 and assign Express a different port (e.g., 3001), or vice versa.
	•	Update your .replit or replit.nix file accordingly.

3. Define the /graph Endpoint Properly
	•	FastAPI:

@app.get("/graph")
def read_graph():
    return {"message": "Graph endpoint is working!"}


	•	Express (Node/TypeScript):

app.get("/graph", (req, res) => {
  res.send({ message: "Graph endpoint is working!" });
});


	•	If using a GraphQL library (like express-graphql or Apollo), ensure the path is set to /graph (or /graphql) and your client calls the same.

4. Align Client Calls
	•	The console shows repeated GET requests to /graph resulting in 404.
	•	Check that your frontend or test code matches the route exactly (/graph vs. /graphql, etc.).

5. Clean Up Dependencies (Optional)
	•	The message about “Re-optimizing dependencies because lockfile has changed” is typically harmless but can indicate lockfile mismatches.
	•	If necessary, remove or update lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, or poetry.lock), then reinstall.

6. Retest
	•	After applying the above fixes, rerun the Repl.
	•	Observe the console for successful startup messages, port confirmations, and any errors.
	•	Visit https://<your-repl-subdomain>.repl.co/graph in your browser or a REST client to confirm a 2xx response.

Summary:
	1.	Choose which framework actually serves /graph.
	2.	Avoid port conflicts by assigning only one service to 3000.
	3.	Define a matching route in your code for /graph.
	4.	Verify your client points to the correct URL.
	5.	Retest and confirm the 404 errors are resolved.
