Prompt Instruction:

Investigate why the TypeScript compiler cannot resolve certain modules, why some JSX components are failing to render, and why parameters and imports have mismatched or missing types. Specifically, determine if:
	1.	The @ alias paths are configured properly in tsconfig.json.
	2.	All third-party libraries (e.g., cytoscape, @/lib/queryClient, UI libraries) have type definitions installed or declared.
	3.	React components (e.g., Loader2) have valid types for usage in JSX.
	4.	Event handlers are correctly typed, especially when noImplicitAny is enabled.
	5.	Unused imports (e.g., screen) are cleaned up or properly utilized.

Procedure for Correcting the Code:
	1.	Check TypeScript Configuration:
	•	In your tsconfig.json, confirm that baseUrl and paths are set up to match your project’s folder structure. For example:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
    // ...
  }
}


	•	Ensure your build tools (Vite, Jest, etc.) also understand these alias paths (they may need a corresponding configuration in vite.config.js or jest.config.js).

	2.	Install and Declare Missing Types:
	•	For libraries such as cytoscape, install the official type definitions:

npm install --save-dev @types/cytoscape

If no official typings exist, create a global.d.ts or typings.d.ts file with a declare module 'library-name'; statement.

	•	Verify that each @/components/... and @/lib/... path has a corresponding TypeScript file or type declaration.

	3.	Fix Invalid JSX Usage:
	•	If Loader2 is a third-party component that isn’t recognized as a valid JSX element, install or configure its TypeScript definitions, or wrap it in a React component that properly defines its props.
	•	Check whether the library exports a valid React component. If it’s a standard SVG or non-React element, you may need a custom wrapper.
	4.	Type Event Handlers Properly:
	•	When noImplicitAny is set, give your handlers explicit types:

const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setIterationCount(e.target.value);
};


	•	This ensures TypeScript knows the shape of e and prevents “implicitly has an ‘any’ type” errors.

	5.	Remove or Use Unused Imports:
	•	If screen from @testing-library/react is never used, remove it to satisfy TypeScript’s unused variable checks or use it properly in your tests.
	6.	Rebuild and Test:
	•	After updating paths, installing type definitions, and fixing invalid JSX usage, run:

npm run build

or

yarn build

Ensure the errors are resolved.

	•	Confirm your tests also pass with:

npm run test

or

yarn test



By methodically addressing each missing module declaration, improper alias configuration, and type mismatch, you will uncover the underlying causes of the compiler errors and restore a clean build.
