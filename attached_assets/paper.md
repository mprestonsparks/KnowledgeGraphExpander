###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our analysis reveals emergent patterns—such as the rise of highly connected “hub” concepts and the shifting influence of “bridge” nodes—indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework’s potential for open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability.

## 1 Introduction

Report issue for preceding element

Scientific inquiry often proceeds through an interplay of incremental refinement and transformative leaps, evoking broader questions of how knowledge evolves under continual reflection and questioning. In many accounts of discovery, sustained progress arises not from isolated insights but from an iterative process in which prior conclusions are revisited, expressed as generalizable ideas, refined, or even reorganized as new evidence and perspectives emerge \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib1 "")\]. Foundational work in category theory has formalized aspects of this recursive structuring, showing how hierarchical representations can unify diverse knowledge domains and enable higher-level abstractions in both the natural and social sciences \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib2 ""), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib3 ""), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib4 "")\]. Across engineering disciplines including materials science, such iterative integration of information has proven essential in synthesizing deeply interlinked concepts.

Recent AI methods, however, often emphasize predictive accuracy and single-step outputs over the layered, self-reflective processes that characterize human problem-solving. Impressive gains in natural language processing, multimodal reasoning \[ [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib5 ""), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib6 ""), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib7 ""), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib8 ""), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib9 ""), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib10 ""), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib11 ""), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib12 "")\], and materials science \[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib13 ""), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib14 ""), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib15 ""), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib16 ""), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib17 "")\], including breakthroughs in molecular biology \[ [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib18 "")\] and protein folding \[ [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib19 ""), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib20 ""), [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib21 "")\], showcase the prowess of large-scale models trained on vast datasets. Yet most of the early systems generate answers in a single pass, sidestepping the symbolic, stepwise reasoning that often underpins scientific exploration. This gap has prompted a line of research into modeling that explicitly incorporates relational modeling, reflection or multi-step inferences \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib2 ""), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib3 ""), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib4 ""), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib22 ""), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib23 ""), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib24 ""), [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib25 ""), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib26 ""), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 ""), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib28 "")\], hinting at a transition from single-shot pattern recognition to more adaptive synthesis of answers from first principles in ways that more closely resemble compositional mechanisms. Thus, a fundamental challenge now is how can we build scientific AI systems that synthesize information rather than memorizing it.

Graphs offer a natural substrate for this kind of iterative knowledge building. By representing concepts and their relationships as a network, it becomes possible to capture higher-order structure—such as hubs, bridging nodes, or densely interconnected communities—that might otherwise remain implicit. This explicit relational format also facilitates systematic expansion: each newly added node or edge can be linked back to existing concepts, reshaping the network and enabling new paths of inference \[ [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib29 ""), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib23 ""), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\]. Moreover, graph-based abstractions can help large language models move beyond memorizing discrete facts; as nodes accumulate and form clusters, emergent properties may reveal cross-domain synergies or overlooked gaps in the knowledge space.

Report issue for preceding element

Recent work suggests that standard Transformer architectures can be viewed as a form of Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), where attention operates over relational structures rather than raw token sequences \[ [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib23 "")\]. Under this lens, each attention head effectively tests for isomorphisms in local neighborhoods of the graph, offering a principled way to capture both global and local dependencies. A category-theoretic perspective further bolsters this approach by providing a unified framework for compositional abstractions: nodes and edges can be treated as objects and morphisms, respectively, while higher-level concepts emerge from functorial mappings that preserve relational structure \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib2 ""), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib3 ""), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib4 "")\]. Taken together, these insights hint at the potential for compositional capabilities in AI systems, where simpler building blocks can be combined and reconfigured to form increasingly sophisticated representations, rather than relying on one-pass computations or static ontologies. By using graph-native modeling and viewing nodes and edges as composable abstractions, such a model may be able to recognize and reapply learned configurations in new contexts—akin to rearranging building blocks to form unanticipated solutions. This compositional approach, strengthened by category-theoretic insights, allows the system to not only interpolate among known scenarios but to extrapolate to genuinely novel configurations. In effect, graph-native attention mechanisms treat interconnected concepts as first-class entities, enabling the discovery of new behaviors or interactions that purely sequence-based methods might otherwise overlook.

Report issue for preceding element

A fundamental challenge remains: How can we design AI systems that, rather than merely retrieving or matching existing patterns, build and refine their own knowledge structures across iterations. Recent work proposes that graphs can be useful strategies to endow AI models with relational capabilities\[ [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib29 ""), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib23 ""), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\] both within the framework of creating graph-native attention mechanisms and by training models to use graphs as native abstractions during learned reasoning phases. Addressing this challenge requires not only methods for extracting concepts but also mechanisms for dynamically organizing them so that new information reshapes what is already known. By endowing large language models with recursively expanding knowledge graph capabilities, we aim to show how stepwise reasoning can support open-ended discovery and conceptual reorganization. The work presented here explores how such feedback-driven graph construction may lead to emergent, self-organizing behaviors, shedding light on the potential for truly iterative AI approaches that align more closely with the evolving, integrative nature of human scientific inquiry. Earlier work on graph-native reasoning has demonstrated that models explicitly taught how to reason in graphs and abstractions can lead to systems that generalize better and are more interpretable \[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\].

Here we explore whether we can push this approach toward ever-larger graphs, creating extensive in situ graph reasoning loops where models spend hours or days developing complex relational structures before responding to a task. Within such a vision, several key issues arise: Will repeated expansions naturally preserve the network’s relational cohesion, or risk splintering into disconnected clusters? Does the continuous addition of new concepts and edges maintain meaningful structure, or lead to saturation and redundancy? And to what extent do bridging nodes, which may initially spark interdisciplinary links, remain influential over hundreds of iterations? In the sections ahead, we investigate these questions by analyzing how our recursively expanded knowledge graphs grow and reorganize at scale—quantifying hub formation, modular stability, and the persistence of cross-domain connectors. Our findings suggest that, rather than collapsing under its own complexity, the system retains coherent, open-ended development, pointing to new possibilities for large-scale knowledge formation in AI-driven research for scientific exploration.

### 1.1 Knowledge Graph Expansion Approaches

Report issue for preceding element

Knowledge graphs are one way to organize relational understanding of the world. They have grown from manually curated ontologies decades ago into massive automatically constructed repositories of facts. A variety of methodologies have been developed for expanding knowledge graphs. Early approaches focused on information extraction from text using pattern-based or open-domain extractors. For example, the DIPRE algorithm \[ [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib30 "")\] bootstrapped relational patterns from a few seed examples to extract new facts in a self-reinforcing loop. Similarly, the KnowItAll system \[ [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib31 "")\] introduced an open-ended, autonomous “generate-and-test” paradigm to extract entity facts from the web with minimal supervision. Open Information Extraction methods like TextRunner \[ [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib32 "")\] and ReVerb \[ [33](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib33 "")\] further enabled unsupervised extraction of subject–predicate–object triples from large text corpora without requiring a predefined schema. These unsupervised techniques expanded knowledge graphs by harvesting new entities and relations from unstructured data, although they often required subsequent mapping of raw extractions to a coherent ontology.

Report issue for preceding element

In parallel, research on knowledge graph completion has aimed to expand graphs by inferring missing links and attributes. Statistical relational learning and embedding-based models (e.g., translational embeddings like TransE \[ [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib34 "")\]) predict new relationships by generalizing from known graph structures. Such approaches, while not fully unsupervised (they rely on an existing core of facts for training), can autonomously suggest plausible new edges to add to a knowledge graph. Complementary to embeddings, logical rule-mining systems such as AMIE \[ [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib35 "")\] showed that high-confidence Horn rules can be extracted from an existing knowledge base and applied to infer new facts recursively. Traditional link prediction heuristics from network science – for example, preferential attachment and other graph connectivity measures – have also been used as simple unsupervised methods to propose new connections in knowledge networks. Together, these techniques form a broad toolkit for knowledge graph expansion, combining text-derived new content with graph-internal inference to improve a graph’s coverage and completeness.

### 1.2 Recursive and Autonomous Expansion Techniques

Report issue for preceding element

A notable line of work seeks to make knowledge graphs growth continuous and self-sustaining – essentially achieving never-ending expansion. The NELL project (Never-Ending Language Learner) \[ [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib36 "")\] pioneered this paradigm, with a system that runs 24/7, iteratively extracting new beliefs from the web, integrating them into its knowledge base, and retraining itself to improve extraction competence each day. Over years of operation, NELL has autonomously accumulated millions of facts by coupling multiple learners (for parsing, classification, relation extraction, etc.) in a semi-supervised bootstrapping loop. This recursive approach uses the knowledge learned so far to guide future extractions, gradually expanding coverage while self-correcting errors; notably, NELL can even propose extensions to its ontology as new concepts emerge.

Report issue for preceding element

Another milestone in autonomous knowledge graph construction was Knowledge Vault \[ [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib37 "")\], which demonstrated web-scale automatic knowledge base population by fusing facts from diverse extractors with probabilistic inference. Knowledge Vault combined extractions from text, tables, page structure, and human annotations with prior knowledge from existing knowledge graphs, yielding a vast collection of candidate facts (on the order of 300 million) each accompanied by a calibrated probability of correctness. This approach showed that an ensemble of extractors, coupled with statistical fusion, can populate a knowledge graph at scales far beyond what manual curation or single-source extraction can achieve. Both NELL and Knowledge Vault illustrate the power of autonomous or weakly-supervised systems that grow a knowledge graph with minimal human intervention, using recursive learning and data fusion to continually expand and refine the knowledge repository.

Report issue for preceding element

More recent research has explored agent-based and reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for knowledge graph expansion and reasoning. Instead of one-shot predictions, these methods allow an agent to make multi-hop queries or sequential decisions to discover new facts or paths in the graph. For example, some work \[ [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib38 "")\] employ an agent that learns to navigate a knowledge graph and find multi-step relational paths, effectively learning to reason over the graph to answer queries. Such techniques highlight the potential of autonomous reasoning agents that expand knowledge by exploring connections in a guided manner (using a reward signal for finding correct or novel information). This idea of exploratory graph expansion aligns with concepts in network science, where traversing a network can reveal undiscovered links or communities. It also foreshadowed approaches like Graph-PReFLexOR \[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\] that treat reasoning as a sequential decision process, marked by special tokens, that can iteratively build and refine a task-specific knowledge graph.

Report issue for preceding element

Applications of these expansion techniques in science and engineering domains underscore their value for discovery \[ [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib29 "")\]. Automatically constructed knowledge graphs have been used to integrate and navigate scientific literature, enabling hypothesis generation by linking disparate findings. A classic example is Swanson’s manual discovery of a connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud’s disease, which emerged by linking two disjoint bodies of literature through intermediate concepts \[ [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib39 ""), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib40 "")\]. Modern approaches attempt to replicate such cross-domain discovery in an automated way: for instance, mining biomedical literature to propose new drug–disease links, or building materials science knowledge graphs that connect material properties, processes, and applications to suggest novel materials, engineering concepts, or designs \[ [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib41 ""), [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib29 "")\].

### 1.3 Relation to Earlier Work and Key Hypothesis

Report issue for preceding element

The prior work discussed in Section [1.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S1.SS2 "1.2 Recursive and Autonomous Expansion Techniques ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") provides a foundation for our approach, which draws on the never-ending learning spirit of NELL \[ [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib36 "")\] and the web-scale automation of Knowledge Vault \[ [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib37 "")\] to dynamically grow a knowledge graph in situ as it reasons. Like those systems, it integrates information from diverse sources and uses iterative self-improvement. However, rather than relying on passive extraction or purely probabilistic link prediction, our method pairs on-the-fly logical reasoning with graph expansion within the construct of a graph-native reasoning LLM. This means each newly added node or edge is both informed by and used for the model’s next step of reasoning. Inspired in part by category theory and hierarchical inference, we move beyond static curation by introducing a principled, recursive reasoning loop that helps maintain transparency in how the knowledge graph evolves. In this sense, the work can be seen as a synthesis of existing ideas—continuous learning, flexible extraction, and structured reasoning—geared toward autonomous problem-solving in scientific domains.

Report issue for preceding element

Despite substantial progress in knowledge graph expansion, many existing methods still depend on predefined ontologies, extensive post-processing, or reinforce only a fixed set of relations. NELL and Knowledge Vault, for instance, demonstrated how large-scale extraction and integration of facts can be automated, but they rely on established schemas or require manual oversight to refine extracted knowledge \[ [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib36 ""), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib37 "")\]. Reinforcement learning approaches such as DeepPath \[ [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib38 "")\] can efficiently navigate existing graphs but do not grow them by generating new concepts or hypotheses.

Report issue for preceding element

By contrast, the work reported here treats reasoning as an active, recursive process that expands a knowledge graph while simultaneously refining its structure. This aligns with scientific and biological discovery processes, where knowledge is not just passively accumulated but also reorganized in light of new insights. Another key distinction is the integration of preference-based objectives, enabling more explicit interpretability of each expansion step. Methods like TransE \[ [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib34 "")\] excel at capturing statistical regularities but lack an internal record of reasoning paths; our approach, in contrast, tracks and justifies each newly added node or relation. This design allows for a transparent, evolving representation that is readily applied to interdisciplinary exploration—such as in biomedicine \[ [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib39 "")\] and materials science \[ [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib41 "")\]—without depending on rigid taxonomies.

Report issue for preceding element

Hence, this work goes beyond conventional graph expansion by embedding recursive reasoning directly into the construction process, bridging the gap between passive knowledge extraction and active discovery. As we show in subsequent sections, this self-expanding paradigm yields scale-free knowledge graphs in which emergent hubs and bridge nodes enable continuous reorganization, allowing the system to evolve its understanding without exhaustive supervision and paving the way for scalable hypothesis generation and autonomous reasoning.

##### Hypothesis.

Report issue for preceding element

We hypothesize that recursive graph expansion enables self-organizing knowledge formation, allowing intelligence-like behavior to emerge without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. Using a pre-trained model, Graph-PReFLexOR (an autonomous graph-reasoning model trained on a corpus of biological and biologically inspired materials principles) we demonstrate that knowledge graphs can continuously expand in a structured yet open-ended manner, forming scale-free networks with emergent conceptual hubs and interdisciplinary bridge nodes. Our findings suggest that intelligence-like reasoning can arise from recursive self-organization, challenging conventional paradigms and advancing possibilities for autonomous scientific discovery and scalable epistemic reasoning.

## 2 Results and Discussion

Report issue for preceding element

We present the results of experiments in which the graph-native reasoning model engages in a continuous, recursive process of graph-based reasoning, expanding its knowledge graph representation autonomously over 1,000 iterations. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a small number of just a few recursive reasoning steps, the experiments reported in this paper explore how knowledge formation unfolds in an open-ended manner, generating a dynamically evolving graph. As the system iterates, it formulates new tasks, refines reasoning pathways, and integrates emerging concepts, progressively structuring its own knowledge representation following the simple algorithmic paradigm delineated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks"). The resulting graphs from all iterations form a final integrated knowledge graph, which we analyze for structural and conceptual insights. Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") depicts the final state of the graph, referred to as graph 𝒢1subscript𝒢1\\mathcal{G}\_{1}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, after the full reasoning process.

The recursive graph reasoning process can be conducted in either an open-ended setting or develoepd into a more tailored manner to address a specific domain or flavor in which reasoning steps are carried out (details, see Materials and Methods). In the example explored here, we focus on designing impact-resistant materials. In this specialized scenario, we initiate the model with a concise, topic-specific prompt – e.g., Describe a way to design impact resistant materials, and maintain the iterative process of extracting structured knowledge from the model’s reasoning. We refer to the resulting graph as 𝒢2subscript𝒢2\\mathcal{G}\_{2}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Despite the narrower focus, the same core principles apply: each new piece of information from the language model is parsed into nodes and edges, appended to a global graph, and informs the next iteration’s query. In this way, 𝒢2subscript𝒢2\\mathcal{G}\_{2}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT captures a highly directed and domain-specific knowledge space while still exhibiting many of the emergent structural traits—such as hub formation, stable modularity, and growing connectivity—previously seen in the more general graph 𝒢1subscript𝒢1\\mathcal{G}\_{1}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") shows the final snapshot for 𝒢2subscript𝒢2\\mathcal{G}\_{2}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. To further examine the emergent structural organization of both graphs, Figures [S1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#Ax1.F1 "Figure S1 ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") and [S2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#Ax1.F2 "Figure S2 ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") display the same graphs with nodes and edges colored according to cluster identification, revealing the conceptual groupings that emerge during recursive knowledge expansion.

Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") shows a comparison of network properties for two graphs (graph 𝒢1subscript𝒢1\\mathcal{G\_{1}}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic\_1 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, see Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") and graph 𝒢2subscript𝒢2\\mathcal{G\_{2}}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic\_2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, see Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")), each computed at the end of their iterations. The scale-free nature of each graph is determined by fitting the degree distribution to a power-law model using the maximum likelihood estimation method. The analysis involves estimating the power-law exponent (α𝛼\\alphaitalic\_α) and the lower bound (xminsubscript𝑥x\_{\\min}italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman\_min end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT), followed by a statistical comparison against an alternative exponential distribution. A log-likelihood ratio (LR) greater than zero and a p𝑝pitalic\_p-value below 0.05 indicate that the power-law distribution better explains the degree distribution than an exponential fit, suggesting that the network exhibits scale-free behavior.

The clustering coefficients (0.1363 and 0.1434) indicate moderate levels of local connectivity, with Graph 2 exhibiting slightly more pronounced local clustering. The small-world nature of both graphs is evident from their average shortest path lengths (5.1596 and 4.8984) and diameters (17 and 13), implying efficient information flow. Modularity values (0.6970 and 0.6932) suggest both graphs have well-defined community structures, with Graph 1 showing marginally stronger modularity, possibly due to its larger size.

The number of nodes and edges both exhibit linear growth with iterations, indicating that the reasoning process systematically expands the graph without saturation. The increase in edges is slightly steeper than that of nodes, suggesting that each new concept introduced is integrated into an increasingly dense network of relationships rather than remaining isolated. This continuous expansion supports the hypothesis that the model enables open-ended knowledge discovery through recursive self-organization.

The average degree of the graph steadily increases, stabilizing around six edges per node. This trend signifies that the knowledge graph maintains a balance between exploration and connectivity, ensuring that newly introduced concepts remain well-integrated within the broader structure. Simultaneously, the maximum degree follows a non-linear trajectory, demonstrating that certain nodes become significantly more connected over time. This emergent hub formation is characteristic of scale-free networks and aligns with patterns observed in human knowledge organization, where certain concepts act as central abstractions that facilitate higher-order reasoning.

The size of the largest connected component (LCC) grows proportionally with the total number of nodes, reinforcing the observation that the graph remains a unified, traversable structure rather than fragmenting into disconnected subgraphs. This property is crucial for recursive reasoning, as it ensures that the system retains coherence while expanding. The average clustering coefficient initially fluctuates but stabilizes around 0.16, indicating that while localized connections are formed, the graph does not devolve into tightly clustered sub-networks. Instead, it maintains a relatively open structure that enables adaptive reasoning pathways.

These findings highlight the self-organizing nature of the recursive reasoning process, wherein hierarchical knowledge formation emerges without the need for predefined ontologies or supervised corrections. The presence of conceptual hubs, increasing relational connectivity, and sustained network coherence suggest that the model autonomously structures knowledge in a manner that mirrors epistemic intelligence. This emergent organization enables the system to navigate complex knowledge spaces efficiently, reinforcing the premise that intelligence-like behavior can arise through recursive, feedback-driven information processing. Further analysis of degree distribution and centrality metrics would provide deeper insights into the exact nature of this evolving graph topology.

These metrics provide deeper insights into the self-organizing behavior of the graph as it expands through iterative reasoning.
The Louvain modularity, depicted in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(a), measures the strength of community structure within the graph. Initially, modularity increases sharply, reaching a peak around 0.75 within the first few iterations. This indicates that the early phases of reasoning lead to the rapid formation of well-defined conceptual clusters. As the graph expands, modularity stabilizes at approximately 0.70, suggesting that the system maintains distinct knowledge domains while allowing new interconnections to form. This behavior implies that the model preserves structural coherence, ensuring that the recursive expansion does not collapse existing conceptual groupings.

The evolution of the average shortest path length (SPL), shown in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(b), provides further evidence of structured self-organization. Initially, the SPL increases sharply before stabilizing around 4.5–5.0. The initial rise reflects the introduction of new nodes that temporarily extend shortest paths before they are effectively integrated into the existing structure. The subsequent stabilization suggests that the recursive process maintains an efficient knowledge representation, ensuring that information remains accessible despite continuous expansion. This property is crucial for reasoning, as it implies that the system does not suffer from runaway growth in path lengths, preserving navigability.

The staircase-like behavior suggests that the recursive expansion occurs in structured phases, where certain iterations introduce concepts that temporarily extend the longest shortest path before subsequent refinements integrate them more effectively. This bounded expansion indicates that the system autonomously regulates its hierarchical growth, maintaining a balance between depth and connectivity.

These findings reveal several emergent properties of the recursive reasoning model. The stabilization of modularity demonstrates the ability to autonomously maintain structured conceptual groupings, resembling human-like hierarchical knowledge formation.

We note that the bounded expansion of graph diameter suggests that reasoning-driven recursive self-organization is capable of structuring knowledge in a way that mirrors epistemic intelligence, reinforcing the hypothesis that certain forms of intelligent-like behavior can emerge without predefined ontologies.

Degree assortativity coefficient is a measure of the tendency of nodes to connect to others with similar degrees. A negative value indicates disassortativity (high-degree nodes connect to low-degree nodes), while a positive value suggests assortativity (nodes prefer connections to similarly connected nodes). The degree assortativity coefficient (Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(a)) begins with a strongly negative value near −0.250.25-0.25\- 0.25, indicating a disassortative structure where high-degree nodes preferentially connect to low-degree nodes. Over time, assortativity increases and stabilizes around −0.050.05-0.05\- 0.05, suggesting a gradual shift toward a more balanced connectivity structure without fully transitioning to an assortative regime. This trend is consistent with the emergence of hub-like structures, characteristic of scale-free networks, where a few nodes accumulate a disproportionately high number of connections.

This indicates that as the graph expands, an increasingly dense core emerges, reinforcing the formation of highly interconnected substructures. The stepwise progression suggests that specific iterations introduce structural reorganizations that significantly enhance connectivity rather than continuous incremental growth.

We observe that the size of the largest k𝑘kitalic\_k-core (Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(d)) follows a similar pattern, growing in discrete steps and experiencing a sudden drop around iteration 700 before stabilizing again. This behavior suggests that the graph undergoes structural realignments, possibly due to the introduction of new reasoning pathways that temporarily reduce the dominance of the most connected core before further stabilization.

Betweenness Centrality is a measure of how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. High betweenness suggests a critical role in information flow, while a decrease indicates decentralization and redundancy in pathways.

Over time, betweenness declines and stabilizes a bit below 0.01, suggesting that the graph becomes more navigable and distributed, reducing reliance on key bottleneck nodes over more iterations. This trend aligns with the emergence of redundant reasoning pathways, making the system more robust to localized disruptions.

This metric captures the rate at which new relationships are established between nodes, providing insights into the self-organizing nature of the network.

Report issue for preceding element

In the early iterations (0–100), the number of newly connected pairs exhibits high variance, fluctuating between 0 and 400 connections per iteration. This suggests that the initial phase of recursive reasoning leads to significant structural reorganization, where large bursts of new edges are formed as the network establishes its fundamental connectivity patterns. The high variability in this region indicates an exploratory phase, where the graph undergoes rapid adjustments to define its core structure.

Report issue for preceding element

Beyond approximately 200 iterations, the number of newly connected pairs stabilizes around 500–600 per iteration, with only minor fluctuations. This plateau suggests that the knowledge graph has transitioned into a steady-state expansion phase, where new nodes and edges are integrated into an increasingly structured and predictable manner. Unlike random growth, this behavior indicates that the system follows a self-organized expansion process, reinforcing existing structures rather than disrupting them.

The stabilization at a high connection rate suggests the emergence of hierarchical organization, where newly introduced nodes preferentially attach to well-established structures. This pattern aligns with the scale-free properties observed in other experimentally acquired knowledge networks, where central concepts continuously accumulate new links, strengthening core reasoning pathways. The overall trend highlights how recursive self-organization leads to sustained, structured knowledge expansion, rather than arbitrary or saturation-driven growth.

The observed transition from high-variance, exploratory graph expansion to a stable, structured growth phase suggests that recursive self-organization follows a process similar to human cognitive learning and scientific discovery. We believe that this indicates that in early iterations, the system explores diverse reasoning pathways, mirroring how scientific fields establish foundational concepts through broad exploration before refining them into structured disciplines \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib1 "")\]. The stabilization of connectivity beyond 200 iterations reflects preferential attachment dynamics, a hallmark of scale-free networks where highly connected nodes continue to accumulate new links, much like citation networks in academia \[ [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib42 "")\]. This mechanism ensures that core concepts serve as attractors for further knowledge integration, reinforcing structured reasoning while maintaining adaptability. Importantly, the system does not exhibit saturation or stagnation, suggesting that open-ended knowledge discovery is possible through recursive reasoning alone, without requiring predefined ontologies or externally imposed constraints. This aligns with findings in AI-driven scientific hypothesis generation, where graph-based models dynamically infer new connections by iterating over expanding knowledge structures \[ [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib39 ""), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib41 "")\]. The ability of the system to self-organize, expand, and refine its knowledge base autonomously underscores its potential as a scalable framework for automated scientific discovery and epistemic reasoning.

We find the distribution of betweenness centrality to be highly skewed, with the majority of nodes exhibiting values close to zero. Only a small fraction of nodes attain significantly higher centrality values, indicating that very few nodes serve as critical intermediaries for shortest paths. This pattern is characteristic of hierarchical or scale-free networks, where a small number of hub nodes facilitate global connectivity, while most nodes remain peripheral.

However, a few nodes attain substantially higher eigenvector centrality scores, indicating that only a select few nodes dominate the network in terms of global influence. This suggests that the network naturally organizes into a hierarchical structure, where dominant hubs accumulate influence over time, while the majority of nodes play a more peripheral role.

The relatively narrow range of shortest path lengths affirms that the network remains well-integrated, ensuring efficient knowledge propagation and retrieval. The absence of extreme outliers suggests that the recursive expansion process does not lead to fragmented or sparsely connected regions. This structure contrasts with purely random graphs, where shortest path lengths typically exhibit a narrower peak at lower values. The broader peak observed here suggests that the model does not generate arbitrary connections but instead organizes knowledge in a structured manner, balancing global integration with local modularity.

The observed path length distribution supports the hypothesis that recursive graph reasoning constructs an efficiently connected knowledge framework, where most concepts can be accessed within a small number of steps. The presence of some longer paths further suggests that the network exhibits hierarchical expansion, with certain areas developing as specialized subdomains that extend outward from the core structure.

### 2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs

Report issue for preceding element

The evolution of the knowledge graph over iterative expansions discussed so far reveals distinct patterns in knowledge accumulation, conceptual breakthroughs, and interdisciplinary integration. To analyze these processes, we now examine (i) the growth trajectories of major conceptual hubs, (ii) the emergence of new highly connected nodes, and (iii) overall network connectivity trends across iterations. The results of these analyses are presented in Figure [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ 2.6 Structural Evolution of the Knowledge Graph ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks"), which consists of three sub-components.

(b) Histogram of newly emerging high-degree nodes across iterations, indicating phases of conceptual expansion.

The trajectory of hub development (Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(a)) suggests two primary modes of knowledge accumulation: steady growth and conceptual breakthroughs. Certain concepts, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge Graphs, exhibit continuous incremental expansion, reflecting their persistent relevance in structuring knowledge. In contrast, hubs like Bioluminescent Technology and Urban Ecosystems experience extended periods of low connectivity followed by sudden increases in node degree, suggesting moments when these concepts became structurally significant in the knowledge graph. These results indicate that the system does not expand knowledge in a purely linear fashion but undergoes phases of conceptual restructuring, akin to punctuated equilibrium in scientific development.

The emergence of new hubs (Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(b)) further supports this interpretation. Instead of a continuous influx of new central concepts, we observe discrete bursts of hub formation occurring at specific iteration milestones. These bursts likely correspond to the accumulation of contextual knowledge reaching a critical threshold, after which the system autonomously generates new organizing principles to structure its expanding knowledge base. This finding suggests that the system’s reasoning process undergoes alternating cycles of consolidation and discovery, where previously formed knowledge stabilizes before new abstract concepts emerge.

The overall network connectivity trends (Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(c)) demonstrate a steady increase in average node degree, indicating that the graph maintains a structurally stable expansion while integrating additional knowledge. The absence of abrupt drops in connectivity suggests that previously introduced concepts remain relevant and continue to influence reasoning rather than become obsolete. This trend supports the hypothesis that the system exhibits self-organizing knowledge structures, continuously refining its conceptual hierarchy as it expands.

Report issue for preceding element

These observations lead to several overarching conclusions. First, the results indicate that the system follows a hybrid knowledge expansion model, combining gradual accumulation with disruptive conceptual breakthroughs. This behavior closely mirrors the dynamics of human knowledge formation, where foundational ideas develop progressively, but major paradigm shifts occur when conceptual thresholds are crossed. Second, the persistence of high-degree hubs suggests that knowledge graphs generated in this manner do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting; instead, they maintain and reinforce previously established structures while integrating new insights. Third, the formation of new hubs in discrete bursts implies that knowledge expansion is not driven by uniform growth but by self-reinforcing epistemic structures, where accumulated reasoning reaches a tipping point that necessitates new abstract representations.

Report issue for preceding element

Additionally, the system demonstrates a structured directionality in knowledge formation, as evidenced by the smooth increase in average node degree without fragmentation. This suggests that new concepts do not disrupt existing structures but are incrementally woven into the broader network. Such behavior is characteristic of self-organizing knowledge systems, where conceptual evolution follows a dynamic yet cohesive trajectory. The model also exhibits potential for cross-domain knowledge synthesis, as indicated by the presence of nodes that transition into highly connected hubs later in the process. These nodes likely act as bridges between previously distinct knowledge clusters, fostering interdisciplinary connections.

These analyses provide strong evidence that the recursive graph expansion model is capable of simulating key characteristics of scientific knowledge formation. The presence of alternating stability and breakthrough phases, the hierarchical organization of concepts, and the increasing connectivity across knowledge domains all highlight the potential for autonomous reasoning systems to construct, refine, and reorganize knowledge representations dynamically. Future research could potentially focus on exploring the role of interdisciplinary bridge nodes, analyzing the hierarchical depth of reasoning paths, and examining whether the system can autonomously infer meta-theoretical insights from its evolving knowledge graph.

The expansion of the knowledge graph over iterative refinements reveals emergent structural patterns that highlight how knowledge communities form, how interdisciplinary connections evolve, and how reasoning complexity changes over time. These dynamics provide insight into how autonomous knowledge expansion follows systematic self-organization rather than random accumulation.

The number of distinct communities increases as iterations progress, reflecting the system’s ability to differentiate between specialized fields of knowledge. The trend suggests two key observations: (i) an early rapid formation of new communities as novel knowledge domains emerge and (ii) a later stage where the number of communities stabilizes with occasional fluctuations. The latter behavior indicates that rather than indefinitely forming new disconnected knowledge clusters, the system reaches a regime where previously distinct domains remain relatively stable while undergoing minor structural reorganizations. The fluctuations in the later stages may correspond to moments where knowledge clusters merge or when new abstractions cause domain shifts.

The steady, almost linear increase in bridge nodes suggests that as knowledge expands, more concepts naturally emerge as crucial links between different domains. This behavior reflects the self-reinforcing nature of knowledge integration, where new ideas not only expand within their respective fields but also introduce new ways to connect previously unrelated disciplines. Interestingly, there is no evidence of saturation in the number of bridge nodes, implying that the graph remains highly adaptive, continuously uncovering interdisciplinary relationships without premature convergence. This property is reminiscent of human knowledge structures, where interdisciplinary connections become more prevalent as scientific inquiry deepens.

Initially, reasoning depth fluctuates significantly, which corresponds to the early phase of knowledge graph formation when structural organization is still emergent. As iterations progress, the average path length stabilizes, indicating that the system achieves a balance between hierarchical depth and accessibility of information. The early fluctuations may be attributed to the rapid reorganization of knowledge, where some paths temporarily become longer as new concepts emerge before stabilizing into more efficient reasoning structures. The eventual stabilization suggests that the graph reaches an equilibrium in how information propagates through interconnected domains, maintaining reasoning efficiency while still allowing for complex inferential pathways.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the autonomous knowledge expansion model exhibits structured self-organization, balancing specialization and integration. The interplay between distinct community formation, interdisciplinary connectivity, and reasoning depth highlights the emergence of a dynamically evolving but structurally coherent knowledge network. The continuous increase in bridge nodes reinforces the idea that interdisciplinary reasoning remains a central feature throughout the system’s expansion, which may have significant implications for autonomous discovery processes. Future analyses will explore whether certain bridge nodes exhibit long-term persistence as central knowledge connectors or if interdisciplinary pathways evolve dynamically based on newly introduced concepts.

To understand the structural stability of interdisciplinary connections, we further analyze the persistence of bridge nodes—concepts that act as connectors between distinct knowledge domains, over multiple iterations.

The majority of bridge nodes appear only for a limited number of iterations, reinforcing the hypothesis that interdisciplinary pathways frequently evolve as new concepts emerge and replace older ones. This aligns with earlier observations that the knowledge system exhibits a high degree of conceptual dynamism.

However, a subset of bridge nodes remains persistent for hundreds of iterations. These nodes likely correspond to fundamental concepts that sustain long-term interdisciplinary connectivity. Their extended presence suggests that the system does not solely undergo continuous restructuring; rather, it maintains a set of core concepts that act as stable anchors in the evolving knowledge landscape.

These results refine our earlier observations by distinguishing between transient interdisciplinary connections and long-term structural stability. While knowledge graph expansion is dynamic, certain foundational concepts maintain their bridging role, structuring the broader knowledge network over extended periods. This hybrid model suggests that autonomous knowledge expansion does not operate under complete conceptual turnover but instead converges toward the emergence of stable, high-impact concepts that persist across iterations.

Related questions that could be explored in future research is whether these persistent bridge nodes correspond to widely used theoretical frameworks, methodological paradigms, or cross-domain knowledge principles. Additionally, further analysis is needed to examine whether long-term bridge nodes exhibit distinct topological properties, such as higher degree centrality or clustering coefficients, compared to short-lived connectors.

The bridge nodes are sorted by the iteration in which they first appeared, providing a clearer view of how interdisciplinary connectors emerge over time.

Notably, the earliest iterations feature a rapid influx of bridge nodes, reflecting the initial structuring phase of the knowledge graph. Many nodes appear and remain active for extended periods, suggesting that certain concepts establish themselves as core interdisciplinary connectors early in the process. These nodes likely play a foundational role in structuring knowledge integration across domains.

A second notable pattern is the episodic emergence of new bridge nodes, rather than a continuous accumulation. The visualization shows distinct clusters of newly appearing bridge nodes, interspersed with periods of relative stability. These bursts suggest that knowledge integration occurs in structured phases rather than through gradual accumulation. Such phases may represent moments when the system reaches a threshold where newly integrated concepts allow for the creation of previously infeasible interdisciplinary links.

Report issue for preceding element

In contrast to the early-established bridge nodes, a subset of nodes appears only in later iterations. These late-emerging bridge nodes indicate that interdisciplinary roles are notably not static; rather, the system continuously restructures itself, incorporating new ideas as they gain relevance. This supports the hypothesis that certain bridge nodes emerge not from initial structuring but from later stages of conceptual refinement, possibly as higher-order abstractions connecting previously developed knowledge clusters.

Report issue for preceding element

The distribution of bridge node activity also suggests a mix of persistent and transient connectors. While some nodes appear briefly and disappear, others remain active over long stretches. This behavior reinforces the idea that knowledge expansion is both dynamic and structured, balancing exploration (where new connections are tested) and stabilization (where key interdisciplinary links persist).

Report issue for preceding element

We note that the structured emergence of bridge nodes may indicate that interdisciplinary pathways do not form randomly but are shaped by systematic phases of knowledge integration and refinement. Future analyses could explore the long-term impact of early bridge nodes, assessing whether they remain influential throughout the knowledge graph’s evolution, and whether the structure of interdisciplinary connectivity stabilizes or continues to reorganize over extended iterations.

Notably, nodes such as Closed-Loop Life Cycle Design and Human Well-being exhibit high betweenness centrality in the early iterations, suggesting that they played a fundamental role in structuring the initial interdisciplinary landscape. However, as the knowledge graph expanded, these nodes saw a gradual decline in their centrality, indicating that their role as primary connectors was replaced by alternative pathways.

Report issue for preceding element

A second class of bridge nodes, including Adaptability and Resilience of Cities and Artificial Intelligence (AI), maintained high centrality values for a longer duration, suggesting that certain concepts remain essential to interdisciplinary knowledge integration even as the graph evolves. These nodes acted as long-term knowledge stabilizers, facilitating interactions between different research domains throughout a significant portion of the knowledge expansion process.

Report issue for preceding element

Interestingly, a subset of nodes, such as Feedback Mechanism and Outcome, gradually gained importance over time. Unlike early bridge nodes that peaked and declined, these nodes started with lower centrality but increased in influence in later iterations. This suggests that some interdisciplinary pathways only become critical after sufficient knowledge accumulation, reinforcing the idea that interdisciplinary roles are not static but continuously reorganize as the knowledge graph matures.

Report issue for preceding element

Furthermore, we observe that by approximately iteration 400-600, most bridge nodes’ betweenness centrality values begin converging toward lower values, indicating that knowledge transfer is no longer reliant on a small set of nodes. This suggests that, as the graph expands, alternative pathways develop, leading to a more distributed and decentralized knowledge structure where connectivity is no longer dominated by a few highly influential nodes.

Report issue for preceding element

Initially, at Iteration 2, the network is highly centralized, with a small number of nodes exhibiting extremely high betweenness centrality (above 0.6), while the majority of nodes have near-zero values. This indicates that only a few nodes act as critical interdisciplinary connectors, facilitating nearly all knowledge transfer.

Report issue for preceding element

By Iteration 100, the distribution has broadened, meaning that more nodes participate in knowledge transfer. The highest betweenness values have decreased compared to Iteration 2, and more nodes exhibit low but nonzero centrality, suggesting an increase in redundant pathways and reduced dependency on a few dominant bridge nodes.

At Iteration 510, the distribution becomes more skewed again, with fewer nodes having high betweenness centrality and a stronger concentration at low values. This suggests that the network has undergone a phase of structural consolidation, where interdisciplinary pathways reorganize around fewer, more stable bridges.

Finally, at Iteration 1024, the histogram shows that most nodes have low betweenness centrality, and only a few retain moderate values. This suggests that the network has matured into a more distributed structure, where no single node dominates knowledge transfer. The observed trend indicates that as the knowledge graph expands, the burden of interdisciplinary connectivity is increasingly shared among many nodes rather than concentrated in a few.

These results suggest that the system undergoes a dynamic reorganization process, shifting from an initial hub-dominated structure to a more distributed and resilient network. Future work could potentially explore whether these trends continue as the graph scales further and whether the eventual network state remains stable or undergoes additional restructuring.

Report issue for preceding element

To analyze the structural evolution of the knowledge graph, we tracked the changes in betweenness centrality over 1,000 iterations. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node serves as a bridge between other nodes by appearing on shortest paths. A node with high betweenness centrality facilitates interdisciplinary knowledge transfer by linking otherwise disconnected regions of the network.

Between iterations 100 and 500, we observe a continued decline, but at a slower rate. This suggests that knowledge transfer is being shared across more nodes, reducing reliance on a small set of dominant bridges.

Between iterations 50 and 300, the maximum betweenness remains high, fluctuating between 0.3 and 0.5.

After iteration 500, the maximum betweenness exhibits a gradual decline, eventually stabilizing around 0.2. This suggests that the network has successfully decentralized, and knowledge transfer is no longer dominated by a single key node.

By the later iterations, no single node dominates, and knowledge transfer occurs through a decentralized structure.

This evolution suggests that the knowledge graph self-organizes into a more distributed state, where interdisciplinary connectivity is no longer constrained by a few central hubs. Future studies can explore whether this trend continues at larger scales and analyze which specific nodes maintained high betweenness longest and which replaced them in later iterations.

The methodology employs a graph-based reasoning framework to enhance LLM responses through structured knowledge extraction obtained through the method described above.

Panel (b): Correlation heatmap of path-level metrics, computed for the first 30 longest shortest paths. Degree and betweenness centrality are highly correlated, indicating that high-degree nodes frequently serve as key connectors. Eigenvector centrality and PageRank also show strong correlation, highlighting their shared role in capturing node influence. Path density exhibits a weak or negative correlation with centrality measures, suggesting that highly connected nodes often form less dense structures. The metrics were computed for each path by extracting node-level properties (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, PageRank, clustering coefficient) from the original graph and averaging them over all nodes in the path. Path density was calculated as the ratio of actual edges to possible edges within the path subgraph. Correlations were then derived from these aggregated values across multiple paths.

The extracted longest shortest path depicted in Figure [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F17 "Figure 17 ‣ 2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in 𝒢₂ and analysis using agentic reasoning ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(a) presents a compelling sequence of relationships spanning biotechnology, artificial intelligence, materials science, and sustainability, illustrating how advancements in one domain influence others. The overall logical flow is well-structured, with clear and expected progressions, such as Rare Genetic Disorders leading to Personalized Medicine and Knowledge Discovery, reflecting that the model captures the increasing role of AI in medical research. The sequence from AI Techniques to Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms is similarly intuitive, as computational models underpin predictive simulations across disciplines (details on methods, see Section [4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S4.SS5 "4.5 Agentic Approach to Reason over Longest Shortest Paths ‣ 4 Materials and Methods ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")).

However, some unexpected connections emerge, suggesting areas for further exploration. The link from Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms to Impact-Resistant Materials stands out – not as a weak connection, but as an intriguing suggestion of AI-driven materials design rather than mere discovery. Computational techniques, such as reinforcement learning and generative modeling, could optimize material structures for durability, opening new pathways in materials engineering. Another unconventional relationship is the transition from Biodegradable Microplastic Materials to Infrastructure Design. These two areas typically operate separately, yet this link may hint at the emergence of biodegradable composites for construction or sustainable materials engineering. Further investigation into the practical applications of biodegradable materials in structural design could strengthen this connection.

A notable redundancy appears in the presence of Pollution Mitigation twice, spelled differently, which results from a lack of node merging rather than a distinct conceptual relationship. This duplication suggests that similar concepts are being represented as separate nodes, potentially affecting graph-based reasoning. Similarly, Self-Healing Materials in Infrastructure Design loops back to Pollution Mitigation, reinforcing an already established sustainability link. While valid, this repetition could be streamlined for clarity.

We find that the logical progression effectively captures key interdisciplinary relationships while revealing areas for refinement. The structure underscores the increasing role of AI in materials science, the integration of sustainability into materials design, and the interplay between predictive modeling and physical sciences. Addressing node duplication and refining transitions between traditionally separate fields—such as biodegradable materials in construction—would enhance the clarity and coherence of the path, making it an even more insightful representation of scientific knowledge.

##### Agentic Reasoning over the Path

Report issue for preceding element

We apply an agentic model to analyze the longest shortest path. For this analysis, an agentic system first analyzes each node in the subgraph, then each of the relationships, and then synthesizes them into a “Final Synthesized Discovery” (in blue font for clarity). The analysis identifies key concepts such as biodegradable microplastics, self-healing materials, pollution mitigation, and AI-driven predictive modeling, ultimately synthesizing the Bio-Inspired, Adaptive Materials for Resilient Ecosystems (BAMES) paradigm. The resulting document, [Supporting Text 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#supporting_text_1 "discovery_sample.pdf ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks"), presents the results.

The proposed discovery proposes self-healing, bio-inspired materials that integrate microbial, plant, and animal-derived mechanisms with AI-driven optimization to create adaptive, environmentally responsive materials. By embedding microorganisms for pollutant degradation and leveraging machine learning for real-time optimization, the model suggests that BAMES extends conventional self-healing materials beyond infrastructure applications into active environmental remediation \[ [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib43 "")\]. The concept of temporal memory, where materials learn from past environmental conditions and adjust accordingly, introduces a novel paradigm in smart materials \[ [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib44 "")\]. Additionally, the hypothesis that interconnected materials could develop emergent, collective behavior akin to biological ecosystems presents an interesting perspective on material intelligence and sustainability \[ [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib45 ""), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib46 "")\].

The flowchart illustrates the hierarchical process of compositional reasoning, beginning with atomic components (fundamental scientific concepts, left, as identified in the longest shortest path (Figure [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F17 "Figure 17 ‣ 2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in 𝒢₂ and analysis using agentic reasoning ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")(a))) and progressing through pairwise fusions, bridge synergies, and a final expanded discovery. Each stage (Steps A, B, C and D) integrates concepts systematically, ensuring interoperability, generativity, and hierarchical refinement, culminating in the EcoCycle framework for sustainable infrastructure development. Report issue for preceding element

The example ultimately presents a structured approach to compositional scientific discovery, integrating principles from infrastructure materials science, environmental sustainability, and artificial intelligence to develop a novel framework for sustainable infrastructure, termed EcoCycle. As can be seen in [Supporting Text 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#supporting_text_2 "compositional_1_20250217_140156.pdf ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") and in Figure [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F18 "Figure 18 ‣ Agentic Compositional Reasoning ‣ 2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in 𝒢₂ and analysis using agentic reasoning ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks"), the compositional reasoning process proceeded through multiple hierarchical steps, ensuring the systematic combination of concepts with well-defined relationships.

Report issue for preceding element

At the foundational level, atomic components were identified, each representing an independent domain concept, such as biodegradable microplastic materials, self-healing materials, predictive modeling, and knowledge discovery. These fundamental elements were then combined into pairwise fusions, leveraging shared properties to generate novel synergies. For instance, the fusion of self-healing materials with pollution mitigation led to environmental self-healing systems, integrating autonomous repair mechanisms with pollution reduction strategies. Similarly, combining impact-resistant materials with machine learning algorithms enabled damage forecasting systems, enhancing predictive maintenance in infrastructure.

Report issue for preceding element

The validity of this compositional reasoning was established by ensuring that each fusion preserved the integrity of its constituent concepts while generating emergent functionalities. The process adhered to key compositionality principles: (1) Interoperability, ensuring that combined components interacted meaningfully rather than arbitrarily; (2) Generativity, whereby new properties emerged that were not present in the individual components; and (3) Hierarchical Refinement, wherein smaller-scale synergies were recursively integrated into higher-order bridge synergies. This led to overarching themes such as the intersection of environmental sustainability and technological innovation and the holistic understanding of complex systems, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.

Ultimately, these synergies converged into the EcoCycle framework, encapsulating self-healing, eco-responsive, and AI-optimized infrastructure solutions. The structured composition ensured that emergent discoveries were not mere aggregations but cohesive, context-aware innovations, validating the methodological rigor of the compositional approach. Using a strategy of adhering to systematic composition principles, the method used here demonstrates how interdisciplinary insights can be synthesized into scientific concepts.

Putting this into context, earlier work \[ [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib47 ""), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib48 ""), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib49 ""), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib50 "")\] have highlighted significant limitations in large language models (LLMs) concerning their ability to perform systematic compositional reasoning, particularly in domains requiring logical integration and generalization. Our approach directly addresses these deficiencies by structuring reasoning processes in a progressive and interpretable manner. Despite possessing individual components of knowledge, LLMs often struggle to integrate these dynamically to detect inconsistencies or solve problems requiring novel reasoning paths. We mitigate this by explicitly encoding relationships between concepts within a graph structure. Unlike conventional LLMs that rely on associative pattern recognition or statistical co-occurrence \[ [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib47 "")\], our structured approach mitigates the concerns of mere connectionist representations by enforcing rule-based, interpretable generalization mechanisms that allow for dynamic recombination of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Further, our approach ensures that each reasoning step builds upon prior knowledge in a structured hierarchy. Steps A-D in our framework progressively construct solutions by leveraging explicit connections between concepts, enforcing compositionality rather than assuming it. For example, our approach connects biodegradable microplastic materials with self-healing materials, not merely through surface-level similarities but through defined mechanisms such as thermoreversible gelation and environmental interactions. Instead of expecting an LLM to infer relationships in a single step, our agentic model progressively traverses reasoning graphs, ensuring that the final outcome emerges through logically justified intermediary steps. This not only reduces reliance on pattern memorization but also enhances interpretability and robustness in novel scenarios.

By explicitly structuring relationships between concepts, breaking down reasoning into progressive steps, and incorporating dynamic knowledge recombination, our approach achieves a higher level of structured compositionality that conventional LLMs struggle with.

Critically, instead of simply identifying the shortest path, the algorithm introduces stochastic elements by selecting waypoints and modifying priority queues in a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm. This allows for the discovery of richer and more diverse paths in a knowledge graph. The resulting paths serve as the foundation for graph-based reasoning specifically geared towards research hypothesis generation, ensuring a more extensive and insightful exploration of scientific concepts.

The resulting document [Supporting Text 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#supporting_text_4 "proposal_1.pdf ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") presents the results of applying SciAgents to 𝒢2subscript𝒢2\\mathcal{G}\_{2}caligraphic\_G start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the context of impact-resistant materials and infrastructure resilience. The graph representation serves as a structured framework for reasoning about the relationships between key concepts—impact-resistant materials, self-healing mechanisms, machine learning optimization, and modular infrastructure—by encoding dependencies and influences between them. Graph 2 specifically captures these interconnected domains as nodes, with edges representing logical or causal links, enabling a systematic exploration of pathways that lead to optimal material design strategies. The path traversal within the graph identifies key dependencies, such as how impact-resistant materials influence infrastructure resilience or how machine learning refines self-healing efficiency. This structured pathway-based reasoning allows SciAgents to generate research hypotheses that maximize cross-domain synergies, ensuring that material properties are not optimized in isolation but rather in concert with their broader applications in engineering and sustainability. Furthermore, graph traversal reveals emergent relationships—such as how integrating real-time sensor feedback into modular infrastructure could create self-improving materials—that might not be immediately evident through conventional linear analysis. Thus, the use of graph-based reasoning is pivotal in formulating a research framework that is not only interdisciplinary but also systematically optimized for long-term infrastructure resilience and material adaptability.

In terms of specific content, the proposed research explores an advanced composite material that integrates carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced polymer matrices with self-healing microcapsules, embedded sensor networks, and closed-loop ML optimization. The goal is to create a dynamically self-improving material system that enhances impact resistance and longevity in modular infrastructure. The material design is structured around several key components: (1) CNT reinforcement (1–2 wt%) to improve tensile strength and fracture toughness, (2) self-healing microcapsules (50–200 μ𝜇\\muitalic\_μm) filled with polymerizable agents, (3) embedded graphene-based or PVDF strain sensors for real-time monitoring, and (4) adaptive ML algorithms that regulate stress distributions and healing responses.

The proposal establishes interconnections between several domains, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the research: impact-resistant materials are a subset of general materials with enhanced energy dissipation properties, modular infrastructure benefits from these materials due to increased durability, self-healing materials reduce maintenance cycles, and machine learning optimizes real-time responses to structural stress. This holistic framework aims to advance infrastructure resilience and sustainability. The research hypothesizes that embedding self-healing microcapsules within a CNT-reinforced polymer matrix will yield a composite with superior impact resistance and adaptive repair capabilities. Expected performance gains include a 50% increase in impact energy absorption (surpassing 200 J/m²), up to 80% recovery of mechanical properties after micro-damage, an estimated 30% improvement in yield strain, a 50% extension in structural lifetime, and a 30% reduction in required maintenance interventions.

Compared to conventional high-performance composites such as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and standard carbon fiber-reinforced polymers, the proposed material demonstrates superior mechanical performance and autonomous damage remediation. Traditional impact-resistant materials typically absorb 120–150 J/m² of energy, whereas this system is designed to exceed 200 J/m².

While the upfront processing cost is higher due to advanced material fabrication and sensor integration, the long-term cost per operational year is projected to be competitive with, or superior to, existing alternatives.

## 3 Conclusion

Report issue for preceding element

This work introduced a framework for recursive graph expansion, demonstrating that self-organizing intelligence-like behavior can emerge through iterative reasoning without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. Unlike conventional knowledge graph expansion techniques that rely on static extractions, probabilistic link predictions, or reinforcement learning-based traversal, extensive test-time compute Graph-PReFLexOR graph reasoning actively restructures its own knowledge representation as it evolves, allowing for dynamic adaptation and autonomous knowledge synthesis. These findings are generally in line with other recent results that elucidated the importance of inference scaling methods \[ [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib25 ""), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib52 ""), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib53 ""), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib26 "")\].

Through extensive graph-theoretic analysis, we found that the recursively generated knowledge structures exhibit scale-free properties, hierarchical modularity, and sustained interdisciplinary connectivity, aligning with patterns observed in human knowledge systems. The formation of conceptual hubs (Figures [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")- [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")) and the emergence of bridge nodes (Figures [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ 2.7 Persistence of Bridge Nodes in Knowledge Evolution ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")) demonstrate that the system autonomously organizes information into a structured yet flexible network, facilitating both local coherence and global knowledge integration. Importantly, the model does not appear to saturate or stagnate; instead, it continuously reorganizes relationships between concepts by reinforcing key conceptual linkages while allowing new hypotheses to emerge through iterative reasoning (Figures [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ 2.6 Structural Evolution of the Knowledge Graph ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks") and [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F14 "Figure 14 ‣ 2.9 Evolution of Key Bridge Nodes Over Iterations ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")).

One of the most striking findings is the self-regulation of knowledge propagation pathways. The early stages of graph expansion relied heavily on a few dominant nodes (high betweenness centrality), but over successive iterations, knowledge transfer became increasingly distributed and decentralized (Figure [S3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#Ax1.F3 "Figure S3 ‣ Supplementary Information ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")). This structural transformation suggests that recursive self-organization naturally reduces bottlenecks, enabling a more resilient and scalable knowledge framework. Additionally, we observed alternating phases of conceptual stability and breakthrough, indicating that knowledge formation follows a punctuated equilibrium model, rather than purely incremental accumulation.

Report issue for preceding element

More broadly, the recursive self-organization process produces emergent, fractal-like knowledge structures, suggesting that similar principles may underlie both human cognition and the design of intelligent systems \[ [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib42 "")\]. Moreover, the potential role of bridge nodes—as connectors and as natural intervention points—is underscored by their persistent yet shifting influence, implying they could be strategically targeted for system updates or error correction in a self-organizing network. Additionally, the observed alternating phases of stable community formation punctuated by sudden breakthroughs appear to mirror the concept of punctuated equilibrium in scientific discovery \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib1 "")\], offering a promising framework for understanding the natural emergence of innovation. These insights extend the implications of our work beyond scientific discovery, hinting at broader applications in autonomous reasoning, such as adaptive natural language understanding and real-time decision-making in complex environments. We demonstrated a few initial use cases where we used graph structures in attempts towards compositional reasoning, as shown in Figure [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F18 "Figure 18 ‣ Agentic Compositional Reasoning ‣ 2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in 𝒢₂ and analysis using agentic reasoning ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks").

### 3.1 Graph Evolution Dynamics: Interplay of Network Measures

Report issue for preceding element

The evolution of the knowledge graph reveals a complex interplay between growth, connectivity, centralization, and structural reorganization, with different network-theoretic measures exhibiting distinct yet interdependent behaviors over iterations. Initially, the system undergoes rapid expansion, as seen in the near-linear increase in the number of nodes and edges (Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")). However, despite this outward growth, the clustering coefficient stabilizes early (around 0.16), suggesting that the graph maintains a balance between connectivity and modularity rather than devolving into isolated clusters. This stabilization indicates that the system does not expand chaotically but instead integrates new knowledge in a structured and preferentially attached manner, reinforcing key concepts while allowing for exploration.

Report issue for preceding element

One of the most informative trends is the evolution of betweenness centrality (Figure [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F16 "Figure 16 ‣ 2.11 Evolution of Betweenness Centrality in the Knowledge Graph ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")), which starts highly concentrated in a few key nodes but then redistributes over time, reflecting a transition from hub-dominated information flow to a more decentralized and resilient network. This shift aligns with the gradual stabilization of average shortest path length (around 4.5, see Figure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 2.4 Analysis of Node Centrality Distributions at Final Stage of Reasoning ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")) and the graph diameter (around 16–18 steps, see Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")), implying that while knowledge expands, it remains navigable and does not suffer from excessive fragmentation. Meanwhile, the maximum k𝑘kitalic\_k-core index (Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")) exhibits a stepwise increase, reflecting structured phases of densification where core knowledge regions consolidate before expanding further. This suggests that the system undergoes punctuated reorganization, where newly introduced concepts occasionally necessitate internal restructuring before further outward growth.

Report issue for preceding element

Interestingly, the degree assortativity starts strongly negative (around -0.25) and trends toward neutrality (-0.05), indicating that high-degree nodes initially dominate connections but later distribute their influence, allowing mid-degree nodes to contribute to network connectivity. This effect is reinforced by the persistence of bridge nodes (Figures [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")- [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#S2.F16 "Figure 16 ‣ 2.11 Evolution of Betweenness Centrality in the Knowledge Graph ‣ 2 Results and Discussion ‣ Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks")), where we see a long-tail distribution of interdisciplinary connectors—some nodes serve as transient links that appear briefly, while others persist across hundreds of iterations, indicating stable, high-impact conceptual connectors.

Report issue for preceding element

Taken together, these experimentally observed trends suggest that the system self-regulates its expansion, dynamically shifting between growth, consolidation, and reorganization phases. The absence of saturation in key structural properties (such as new edge formation and bridge node emergence) indicates that the model supports continuous knowledge discovery, rather than converging to a fixed-state representation. This emergent behavior, where network-wide connectivity stabilizes while conceptual expansion remains open-ended, suggests that recursive graph reasoning could serve as a scalable foundation for autonomous scientific exploration, adaptive learning, and self-organizing knowledge systems.

### 3.2 Relevance in the Context of Materials Science

Report issue for preceding element

The framework introduced in this work offers a novel paradigm for accelerating discovery in materials science by systematically structuring and expanding knowledge networks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on static databases or predefined ontologies \[ [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib54 ""), [55](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib55 ""), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib56 ""), [57](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib57 ""), [58](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib58 "")\], our self-organizing method enables dynamic hypothesis generation, uncovering hidden relationships between material properties, synthesis pathways, and functional behaviors. The emergent scale-free networks observed in our experiments reflect the underlying modularity and hierarchical organization often seen in biological and engineered materials, suggesting that recursive graph-based reasoning could serve as a computational analogue to self-assembling and adaptive materials.
Applied to materials design, the approach developed in this paper could reveal unexpected synergies between molecular architectures and macroscale performance, leading to new pathways for bioinspired, multifunctional, and self-healing materials. Future work can integrate experimental data directly into these reasoning loops, allowing AI-driven materials discovery to move beyond retrieval-focused recognition toward novel inference and innovation. We believe it is essential to bridge the gap between autonomous reasoning and materials informatics to ultimately create self-improving knowledge systems that can adaptively guide materials engineering efforts in real-time \[ [59](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib59 "")\].

### 3.3 Broader Implications

Report issue for preceding element

The observations put forth in this paper have potential implications for AI-driven scientific reasoning, autonomous hypothesis generation, and scientific inquiry. As our results demonstrate, complex knowledge structures can self-organize without explicit goal-setting. This work challenges a prevailing assumption that intelligence requires externally imposed constraints or supervision. Instead, it suggests that intelligent reasoning may emerge as a fundamental property of recursive, feedback-driven information processing, mirroring cognitive processes observed in scientific discovery and human learning. Our experiments that directed the evolution of the thinking mechanisms towards a certain goal were provided with relational modeling that incorporated these concepts in a more pronounced manner, as expected, provisioning a powerful substrate for deeper reasoning.

Report issue for preceding element

Future work could potentially explore extending this framework to multi-agent reasoning environments, cross-domain knowledge synthesis, and real-world applications in AI-driven research discovery. Additionally, refining interpretability mechanisms will be crucial for ensuring that autonomously generated insights align with human epistemic standards, minimizing risks related to misinformation propagation and reasoning biases. Bridging graph-theoretic modeling, AI reasoning, and self-organizing knowledge dynamics, allowed us to provide a step toward building AI systems capable of autonomous, scalable, and transparent knowledge formation on their own.

Report issue for preceding element

We note that wile our agentic deep graph reasoning framework demonstrates promise in achieving self-organizing knowledge formation, several challenges remain. In particular, the computational scalability of recursive graph expansions and the sensitivity of emergent structures to parameter choices warrant further investigation. Future work should explore robust error-correction strategies, enhanced interpretability of evolving networks, and ethical guidelines to ensure transparency in autonomous reasoning systems, especially if deployed in commercial or public settings beyond academic research. Addressing these issues will not only refine the current model but also paves the way for its application in real-world autonomous decision-making and adaptive learning environments.

Report issue for preceding element

A detailed account of the Graph-PReFLexOR is provided in \[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\]. Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) is an AI model integrating in-situ graph reasoning, symbolic abstraction, and recursive reflection into generative modeling. The model was trained on a set of around 1,000 scientific papers in the biological materials and bio-inspired materials domain, as discussed in \[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\]. We refer readers to the original paper for implementation details, but provide a high-level summary here. The method defines reasoning as a structured mapping:

|  | M:T→(G,P,A),:𝑀→𝑇𝐺𝑃𝐴M:T\\rightarrow(G,P,A),italic\_M : italic\_T → ( italic\_G , italic\_P , italic\_A ) , |  | (2) |

where a given task T𝑇Titalic\_T generates a knowledge graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E)italic\_G = ( italic\_V , italic\_E ) with nodes V𝑉Vitalic\_V representing key concepts and edges E𝐸Eitalic\_E denoting relationships, abstract patterns P𝑃Pitalic\_P capturing structural dependencies, and final answers A𝐴Aitalic\_A. Inspired by category theory, the approach encodes knowledge through hierarchical inference, leveraging isomorphisms to generalize across domains. The model autonomously constructs symbolic representations via a reasoning phase marked by <\|thinking\|> … <\|/thinking\|> tokens, refining understanding before generating outputs. Recursive optimization can further improve logical coherence, aligning responses with generalizable principles, a particular feature that will be expanded on in this paper.

To enhance the adaptability of structured reasoning, Graph-PReFLexOR employs an iterative feedback mechanism:

Through the idea to explicitly model knowledge graphs and symbolic representations, this method attempts to bridge connectionist and symbolic paradigms, facilitating multi-step reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interdisciplinary knowledge expansion. Empirical evaluations in \[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13025v1#bib.bib27 "")\] demonstrated its capability to generalize beyond training data. In this study, we take advantage of the capability of Graph-PReFLexOR to generate graph representations on the fly over a great number of iterations during which the model continues to expand its reasoning tokens.

#### 4.4.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth over Reasoning Iterations

Report issue for preceding element

To analyze the recursive expansion of the knowledge graph, we computed a set of graph-theoretic properties at each iteration using the NetworkX Python library. Graph data was stored in GraphML format, with filenames encoded to reflect the iteration number, allowing for chronological tracking of structural changes. Each graph was sequentially loaded and processed to extract key metrics that characterize its connectivity, topology, and hierarchical organization.

Report issue for preceding element

The fundamental properties of the graph, including the number of nodes and edges, were directly retrieved from the graph structure. The degree distribution was computed across all nodes to derive the average degree, representing the mean connectivity per node, and the maximum degree, which highlights the most connected node at each iteration. To assess network cohesion, the largest connected component (LCC) was extracted by identifying the largest strongly connected component in directed graphs and the largest connected subgraph in undirected cases. The clustering coefficient was computed using the standard local clustering metric, which quantifies the likelihood that a node’s neighbors are also connected to each other. The average clustering coefficient was obtained by averaging over all nodes in the graph, providing insight into the tendency of local structures to form tightly connected clusters.

Report issue for preceding element

To assess global connectivity and efficiency, we computed the average shortest path length (SPL) and the graph diameter within the largest connected component. The SPL was obtained by calculating the mean shortest path distance between all pairs of nodes in the LCC, while the diameter was determined as the longest shortest path observed in the component. Since these calculations are computationally expensive for large graphs, they were conditionally executed only when the LCC was sufficiently small or explicitly enabled in the analysis. For community detection, we applied the Louvain modularity algorithm using the community-louvain package. The graph was treated as undirected for this step, and the modularity score was computed by partitioning the graph into communities that maximize the modularity function. This metric captures the extent to which the graph naturally organizes into distinct clusters over iterations.

The entire analysis pipeline iterated over a series of GraphML files, extracting the iteration number from each filename and systematically computing these metrics. The results were stored as time series arrays and visualized through multi-panel plots, capturing trends in network evolution. To optimize performance, computationally intensive operations, such as shortest path calculations and modularity detection, were executed conditionally based on graph size and software availability. To further examine the structural evolution of the recursively generated knowledge graph, we computed a set of advanced graph-theoretic metrics over iterative expansions.

The degree assortativity coefficient was computed to measure the correlation between node degrees, assessing whether high-degree nodes preferentially connect to similar nodes. This metric provides insight into the network’s structural organization and whether its expansion follows a preferential attachment mechanism. The global transitivity, defined as the fraction of closed triplets among all possible triplets, was calculated to quantify the overall clustering tendency of the graph and detect the emergence of tightly interconnected regions. To assess the hierarchical connectivity structure, we performed k𝑘kitalic\_k-core decomposition, which identifies the maximal subgraph where all nodes have at least k𝑘kitalic\_k neighbors. We extracted the maximum k𝑘kitalic\_k-core index, representing the deepest level of connectivity within the network, and computed the size of the largest k𝑘kitalic\_k-core, indicating the robustness of highly connected core regions.

For understanding the importance of individual nodes in information flow, we computed average betweenness centrality over the largest connected component. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which nodes serve as intermediaries in shortest paths, highlighting critical nodes that facilitate efficient navigation of the knowledge graph. Since exact computation of betweenness centrality can be computationally expensive for large graphs, it was performed only within the largest component to ensure feasibility. Additionally, we identified articulation points, which are nodes whose removal increases the number of connected components in the network. The presence and distribution of articulation points reveal structural vulnerabilities, highlighting nodes that serve as key bridges between different knowledge regions.

Numerically, the longest paths are determined by computing node eccentricities using networkx.eccentricity(), which identifies the most distant node pairs in terms of shortest paths. The five longest shortest paths are extracted with networkx.shortest\_path(). For each extracted path, we assign node-level structural metrics computed from the original graph. The node degree is obtained using networkx.degree(), betweenness centrality is computed with networkx.betweenness\_centrality(), and closeness centrality is determined via networkx.closeness\_centrality(). Each identified path is saved as a GraphML file using networkx.write\_graphml() with these computed node attributes for further analysis.

#### 4.5.1 Agent-driven Compositional Reasoning

Report issue for preceding element

We employ a multi-step agentic approach that couples LLMs with graph-based compositional reasoning. To develop such an approach, we load the graph and locate its largest connected component. We compute eccentricities to identify two far-apart nodes, then extract the longest shortest path between them. Each node in that path becomes a “building block,” for which the LLM provides a concise definition, principles, and a property conducive to synergy (Step A). Next, we prompt the LLM to create pairwise synergies by merging adjacent building blocks, encouraging a short, compositional statement that unifies the nodes’ respective features (Step B). To deepen the layering of ideas, we consolidate multiple synergy statements into bridge synergies that capture cross-cutting themes (Step C). Finally, we issue a more elaborate prompt asking the LLM to integrate all building blocks and synergies into an expanded, coherent “final discovery,” referencing both prior statements and each node’s defining traits (Step D). This process yields a multi-step compositional approach, wherein each synergy can build on earlier results to reveal increasingly sophisticated connections. The initial steps A-C are carried out using [meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/html/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct ""), whereas the final integration of the response in Step D is conducted using [meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/html/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct ""). We also experimented with other models, such as o1-pro as discussed in the main text.

### 4.6 Scale free analysis

Report issue for preceding element

To determine whether a given network exhibits scale-free properties, we analyze its degree distribution using the power-law fitting method implemented in the powerlaw Python package. The algorithm extracts the degree sequence from the input graph and fits a power-law distribution, estimating the exponent α𝛼\\alphaitalic\_α and lower bound xminsubscript𝑥x\_{\\min}italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman\_min end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. To assess whether the power-law is a preferable fit, we compute the log-likelihood ratio (LR) between the power-law and an exponential distribution, along with the corresponding p𝑝pitalic\_p-value. A network is classified as scale-free if LR is positive and p<0.05𝑝0.05p<0.05italic\_p < 0.05, indicating statistical support for the power-law hypothesis. The method accounts for discrete degree values and excludes zero-degree nodes from the fitting process.
