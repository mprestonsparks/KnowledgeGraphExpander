# User Guide

## Getting Started

### Interface Overview
The knowledge graph interface consists of:
1. **Graph Visualization Area** - Main display of nodes and connections
2. **Control Panel** - Tools for interacting with the graph
3. **Information Panel** - Details about selected nodes and clusters

### Basic Operations

#### Expanding the Graph
1. Enter a prompt in the expansion input
2. Click "Expand" to add new knowledge
3. Watch as new nodes and connections appear

#### Working with Clusters
- **View Clusters**: Nodes are colored by their semantic grouping
- **Recalculate**: Use "Reapply Clustering" to update groups
- **Reconnect**: Connect isolated nodes to the main graph

### Navigation

#### Graph Interaction
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or pinch gesture
- **Pan**: Click and drag the background
- **Select**: Click on nodes or edges
- **Move**: Drag nodes to reposition

#### Node Information
- Click a node to view details
- View connected nodes and relationships
- See cluster membership and metrics

### Advanced Features

#### Semantic Analysis
The system automatically:
- Groups related concepts
- Identifies central nodes
- Calculates relationship strengths

#### Real-time Updates
- Graph changes are reflected immediately
- Cluster updates happen automatically
- Live collaboration support

### Best Practices

1. **Graph Expansion**
   - Use clear, specific prompts
   - Build knowledge incrementally
   - Review new connections

2. **Cluster Management**
   - Regularly recalculate clusters
   - Check for disconnected nodes
   - Monitor cluster coherence

3. **Performance**
   - Work with visible sections
   - Use filters when needed
   - Clear browser cache if needed

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + +`: Zoom in
- `Ctrl + -`: Zoom out
- `Ctrl + 0`: Reset zoom
- `Esc`: Deselect nodes

## Tips and Tricks
1. Use semantic clustering for better organization
2. Regularly reconnect disconnected nodes
3. Monitor cluster coherence scores
4. Use clear node labels for better understanding
