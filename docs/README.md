# Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers the Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Knowledge Network system developed by M. Preston Sparks ([@mprestonsparks](https://github.com/mprestonsparks)), implementing the architecture proposed by Buehler (2025). The system features multi-agent collaborative reasoning, temporal evolution tracking, feedback loop mechanisms, advanced graph merging, and self-organization capabilities as described in the original research.

## Key Features Documentation

### Multi-Agent Reasoning System

The system implements a collaborative multi-agent approach for knowledge graph expansion:

1. **Explorer Agent**: Identifies new concepts and relationships based on input prompts
2. **Critic Agent**: Evaluates the quality and relevance of proposed additions
3. **Connector Agent**: Identifies how new knowledge connects to existing structures
4. **Integrator Agent**: Synthesizes the final knowledge representation

Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md).

### Temporal Evolution Tracking

The system tracks how the knowledge graph evolves over time:

- Historical snapshots of graph state
- Growth rate analysis
- Hub and bridge node formation tracking
- Scale-free property emergence monitoring

See the [Components](components.md) document for implementation details.

### Feedback Loop Mechanism

The system implements Buehler's (2025) iterative refinement mechanism using the formula R_{i+1}=f_{eval}(R_i,F_i):

- Expansion quality evaluation using multiple metrics
- Generation of improvement prompts
- Strategy refinement over successive iterations

Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md).

### Advanced Graph Merging

The system performs intelligent merging of new knowledge with existing structures:

- Semantic similarity detection for node merging
- Conflict resolution for edge properties
- Merge history tracking for traceability

See the [Components](components.md) document for implementation details.

### Self-Organization Capabilities

The system enables the graph to organize itself dynamically:

- Emergent clustering based on semantic relationships
- Hub and bridge node formation
- Intelligent reconnection of disconnected nodes
