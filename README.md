## üåü Overview
A self-organizing knowledge graph system that implements Buehler's (2025) agentic deep graph reasoning architecture. The system builds dynamic, evolving knowledge graphs using multi-agent collaborative reasoning, temporal evolution tracking, and advanced self-organization capabilities as described in the original research.

## üß† Key Features

### Multi-Agent Collaborative Reasoning
- **Explorer Agent**: Identifies new concepts and relationships
- **Critic Agent**: Evaluates quality and relevance of proposals
- **Connector Agent**: Creates meaningful connections between concepts
- **Integrator Agent**: Synthesizes final knowledge structures

### Self-Organizing Knowledge Structure
- Automatic emergence of scale-free properties
- Hierarchical clustering with modularity detection
- Hub and bridge node formation without predefined ontologies
- Continuous growth without saturation

### Temporal Evolution Tracking
- Monitors graph growth over time
- Tracks hub formation and evolution
- Records historical snapshots for analysis
- Analyzes power law exponents and other network metrics

### Advanced Graph Merging
- Semantic similarity detection for node merging
- Conflict resolution for edge properties
- Maintains merge history for traceability
- Intelligent reconnection of disconnected nodes

### Feedback Loop Mechanism
- Implements Buehler's (2025) R_{i+1}=f_{eval}(R_i,F_i) formula
- Evaluates expansion quality with multiple metrics
- Generates improvement prompts based on evaluations
- Refines expansion strategies over time

## üìä System Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Interactive graph visualization with D3.js
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Analytics dashboard for metrics
- Content analysis input tools
- In-browser API key configuration

### Backend (Python + FastAPI)
- Graph management and analysis (NetworkX)
- Semantic clustering with advanced algorithms
- Multi-agent reasoning system
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage

### AI Integration
- OpenAI API for semantic analysis and reasoning
- Claude API for multimodal content analysis
- Structured reasoning with thinking state extraction
- Knowledge extraction pipeline

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- Anthropic API key (optional, for multimodal analysis)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mprestonsparks/KnowledgeGraphExpander.git
   cd KnowledgeGraphExpander
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory or use the provided `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys

3. Run the application
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Check for Docker and Docker Compose
   - Build the Docker images (if needed)
   - Start the application containers
   - Automatically find an available port (default: 8000)
   - The application will be available at http://localhost:[PORT]
   
   Note: If the default port is in use, the script will automatically find the next available port.
   
   Once the application is running, you can access:
   
   - **Knowledge Graph Explorer**: http://localhost:[PORT]/explorer
     (A user-friendly interface for working with the knowledge graph)
   
   - **API Documentation**: http://localhost:[PORT]/api/docs
     (Interactive Swagger UI for testing the API directly)

### Command-line Options

The `run.sh` script supports several options:

```bash
./run.sh [options]

Options:
  --persist-db    Persist database data between runs
  --build         Force rebuild of Docker images
  --dev           Run in development mode with hot reloading
  --port=PORT     Specify custom port (default: 8000)
  --help          Show this help message
```

To stop the application:

```bash
./stop.sh

Options:
  --clean    Remove all data (including database volume)
  --force    Force removal of containers even if they're running
  --help     Show this help message
```

### Manual Docker Commands

If you prefer to use Docker commands directly:

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Stop the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
   
4. Remove all data:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

## Advanced Usage

### Development Mode

For local development with hot reloading:

```bash
./run.sh --dev
```

This mounts your local code directories into the container for live code changes.

### Database Persistence

To persist the database data between container restarts:

```bash
./run.sh --persist-db
```

## üìä Research Implementation

This project implements the key algorithms and architecture from Buehler's research on agentic deep graph reasoning and self-organizing knowledge networks (Buehler, 2025).

The implementation focuses on the recursive expansion framework, emergent properties of scale-free networks, and the combination of multiple specialized agents for knowledge discovery as described in Buehler's work.
