# Test Verification Steps

1. First Run - Database Setup:
   - Watch for successful database initialization
   - Verify pool cleanup completes
   - Check for any event loop warnings

2. Parallel Test Execution:
   - Monitor each test suite's output
   - Verify database connections are isolated
   - Check for event loop conflicts
   - Confirm resource cleanup

3. Expected Output:
   ```
   [Database Setup]
   Database initialized successfully
   Pool cleanup completed

   [API Tests]
   Running test_api.py...
   All tests passed

   [Integration Tests]
   Running test_integration.py...
   All tests passed

   [Semantic API Tests]
   Running test_semantic_api.py...
   All tests passed
   ```

4. Error Conditions to Watch:
   - Database connection errors
   - Event loop conflicts
   - Resource cleanup failures
   - Test isolation issues

5. Success Criteria:
   - All tests complete without event loop errors
   - Database connections properly closed
   - No resource leaks between test suites
   - Clean task termination
