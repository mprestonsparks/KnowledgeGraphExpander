# Test Report for Knowledge Graph System

## Test Categories & Status

### 1. Core Infrastructure Tests
- Database Connectivity: ⚠️ Failing
  - Issue: Connection errors in test environment, needs proper DATABASE_URL configuration
  - Priority: High (blocks storage functionality testing)

### 2. Component Tests
- WebSocket Client: ✅ Passing
  - All connection and event handling tests passing
  - Reconnection logic verified

- GraphViewer Component: ⚠️ Partially Working
  - Rendering tests successful
  - Layout and elements correctly initialized
  - Cluster coloring not applying correctly

### 3. Semantic Clustering Tests
- Basic Clustering: ⚠️ Failing
  - Issue: Connected components not being detected correctly
  - Issue: Node coloring not being applied
  - Priority: High (blocks visualization features)

## Required Actions

1. High Priority:
   - Fix graphology-components integration
   - Implement proper cluster color application
   - Add debugging logs for cluster calculation

2. Medium Priority:
   - Add end-to-end testing for clustering workflow
   - Add visualization tests for cluster colors

3. Low Priority:
   - Add performance benchmarks for graph operations
   - Implement stress testing for large graphs

## Next Steps
1. Fix semantic clustering implementation
2. Add proper test cases
3. Verify cluster visualization
