# Test Report for Knowledge Graph System

## Test Categories & Status

### 1. Core Infrastructure Tests
- Database Connectivity: ⚠️ Failing
  - Issue: Connection errors in test environment, needs proper DATABASE_URL configuration
  - Priority: High (blocks storage functionality testing)

### 2. Component Tests
- WebSocket Client: ✅ Passing
  - All connection and event handling tests passing
  - Reconnection logic verified

- GraphViewer Component: ✅ Passing
  - Rendering tests successful
  - Layout and elements correctly initialized

### 3. Integration Tests
- Graph Expansion: Not Yet Implemented
  - Status: Pending
  - Priority: Low (dependent on core functionality)

## Required Actions

1. High Priority:
   - Fix database connection handling in test environment
   - Add proper DATABASE_URL validation and fallback behavior

2. Medium Priority:
   - Add end-to-end testing for graph expansion workflow
   - Implement integration tests for OpenAI interactions

3. Low Priority:
   - Add performance benchmarks for graph operations
   - Implement stress testing for WebSocket connections

## Next Steps
1. Configure test database environment
2. Implement proper test data setup/teardown
3. Add integration test coverage for graph operations
